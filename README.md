# ListNow-Task-Notifier
This is my first Android App.
A simple task listing app for the user. The user can refer to it in order to decide his/her priorities.
Saves time and keeps the user organized as well as productive.
User(s) will be able to share the list through whatsapp.

This app can be integrated with google(for regular sync), can be connected to contacts, calendar, and clock.
